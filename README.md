# World Happiness
**Vizualizing the countries happiness score from 2015 to 2022 with Tableau**

![World Happiness Dashboard](https://github.com/ferralex/world-happiness/blob/main/world_happiness_dashboard.jpg)

Starting from [these datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mthajnal/worldhappinessreport20152022/metadata) I made a simple yet efficient dashboard using Tableau.

The viz shows the happiness score for most of the countries of the world. Also the values used to determine the happiness are shown when hovering over a country.

The user can filter the data by year (from 2015 to 2022) and by country.

Changing the year, the ranking on the left side changes automatically.

When data is missing, a country is colored in black. A low happiness score is represented with red/orange colors while a higher level is represented with light blue/blue colors.
